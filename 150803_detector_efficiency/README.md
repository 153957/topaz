# Detection efficiency

The detection efficiency for different station configurations is examined. The
efficiency is determined as a function of the shower core distance, the shower
energy, and the shower zenith. The generated CORSIKA showers are used as input
for the groundparticle simulation. By getting the number of events which
satisfy a certain condition (e.g. at least a particle in each corner detector)
compared to the total number of simulations gives an efficiency.

For comparison the efficiencies obtained by David using Aires simulations are
also plotted (for a 1e15 eV shower at 0°, 22.5°, and 35°).

[todo: Additionally expected efficiencies for showers from the Zenith
are derived using the NKG LDF.]
