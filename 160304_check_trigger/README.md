# Check trigger thresholds

Determine the correct trigger thresholds in absolute ADC counts by
reconstructing the trigger using different settings. Using the wrong
settings (to high threshold) results in many failed reconstructions.
Some (~0.1%) failed reconstructions are expected if the data filter was
enabled.

Raw events, with traces are downloaded to perform the reconstructions.
