HiSPARC tijdtest
================

This code is used for the retrieval, storing and analysis of the data from the
tijdtest project.

The tijdtest project tries to determine:

- if there is a time offset between HiSPARC boxes
- if it is a constant offset, or changes over time
- what influences the fluctuations in time offset
- how the gps location is related
- if the use of a different gps antenna and modules affects the offset
- ...

And finally it is meant to determine these time offsets for all HiSPARC boxes
compared to a certain reference box. Allowing us to remove these offsets in
data analysis.
