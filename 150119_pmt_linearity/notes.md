# PMT notes

- Some fibers are not polished properly, causing signal loss.
- Apparently the LED fibers are also not polished on the LED side.
- Reconnecting LED fiber to Bundle fiber can change the signal efficiency.
- Connected multiple random fibers as a quick test and got a pulseheight of 2.7 V.
