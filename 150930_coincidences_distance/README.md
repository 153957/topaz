# Coincidence rate versus distance between stations

Here we look for station pairs which have a certain distance to each other.
Then we find out when they were both working. For each of those periods
coincidence data is downloaded. The number of coincidences divided by the
total time both were on is then the coincidence rate.

Several stations/station pairs have deviating rates. In some cases these
can be explained.

'bad' stations:

- 20001 - GPS has bad sky coverage (possibly UTC?)
- 20002 - station has been moved around 2012
- 20003 - station has been moved around 2012
- 13007 - bad PMT calibration, to many events
- 2103 - unknown, possibly UTC?
- 1010 - partly 2 detectors, others not working well
- 1001 - only 2 detectors, not 4
- 507 - inside Nikhef, much lower event rate
- 22 - Moved to different location

'bad' combinations:

- 7002 & 7003 - detectors not at GPS location?
