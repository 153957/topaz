Discrete directions
===================

The 2.5 ns sample rate of the detectors results in a set of discrete
solutions for any three detectors in a station. Assuming two detectors
have a fixed arrival time and the arrival time of the third varies an
arc will be drawn through the possible directions.

Make discrete direction plots for each combination of 3 detectors in
any 4-detector station. All solutions are shown and several arcs are
drawn for different detectors varying in time.
