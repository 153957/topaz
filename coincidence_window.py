"""Test time windows for coincidences

This script gets the number of found coincidences as a function of the
coincidence window.

TODO: Fix removal of coincidences. Currently this script filters
'self-coindences' but by doing so also removes some potential
coincidences at smaller windows. This is because if station n has 2
events directly after eachother in the combined sorted timestamps list,
the first of those two is removed. This removes the possibility of the
event before that to have a coincidence with the removed event. Should
be fixed by not removing events but adding extra condition that the
stations are not equal in the where.

TODO: Fix coincidences that are subsets. The number of coincidences
should not keep increasing, because at some point one coincidence might
contain another coincidences. e.g. 1, 3, 2 also includes 3, 2. This
should perhaps be counted as only 1 coincidence.

Idea for faster cincidence finding

- Use numpy array
- Find where difference between subsequent elements is less than window
- Then find where difference between those that passed previous check
  also have less difference than window between next (idx+2) element
